1. ATM Simulator Projects:
Many repositories contain Java-based applications that simulate ATM functionality, allowing users to practice common banking transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
Some projects focus on specific features like account management, transaction history, or PIN changes.
You might find projects that use GUI libraries like Swing for a more user-friendly interface. 
2. ATM-Related Concepts:
Some repositories explore cardless transactions, such as using QR codes or SMS for withdrawals. 
You might find projects that focus on the technology behind ATMs, including card readers, host processors, and network communication. 
3. Finding Relevant Repositories:
You can use search terms like "ATM", "ATM simulator", "ATM system", or "automated teller machine" to find relevant repositories. 
GitHub also allows you to search by language (e.g., Java, C++, Python) and by topic (e.g., atm-system, atm-machine). 
When searching, consider using terms related to specific features or technologies you're interested in.
